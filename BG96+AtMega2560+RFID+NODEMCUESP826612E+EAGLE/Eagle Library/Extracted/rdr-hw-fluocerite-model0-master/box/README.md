plexiglass-slide-9cm
--------------------

For individual production using a laser cutter.

A plexiglass "sandwich" -- cut out every layer, stick together with some plexiglass solvent (e.g. acetone) or superglue.

Optimized to fit existing holes at FMFI.

### Notes

#### ...on cutting

- Layers 1, 2 and 6 (6 is the unlabeled one) are to be cut from 3mm plexiglass, layers 3, 4 and 5 from 5mm plexiglass.
- The black-filled areas need to be rastered to about 1mm depth.

#### ...on sticking

**DO NOT FORGET THE NUT!!!** -- put the female screws into the hexagonal holes in layer 2 *before* you stick it with the other layers :-)

- Be careful with acetone: too much and it will eat your box. Supposedly best applied with a syringe to layers slightly pressed together (have faith in capillary action).
- In order to get a precise fit, guides should be used when sticking it. TODO figure it out and elaborate.

#### ...on attaching to the wall

0. Put the board into the bottom component and slide the "T" component (plug built from 2T+3T) into place
1. screw in the big wall screws (you probably want to start with the top one, because the bottom one needs to go **through the T**, not just the bottom)
2. screw the cover onto the bottom

#### ...on screwing :-)

Screws required:

- 2x 2.5mm nut (female screw) / 5mm wrench -- into the hexagonal holes in layer 2
- 2x 2.5mm "long enough" screw for attaching the cover to the bottom
- 2x the screws from the previous boxes (TODO size :D) for attaching the bottom+T to the wall
